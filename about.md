##Who We Are & What We Do
We are a new group that is trying to create a community for anyone in Newfoundland and Labrador that works or has interest in computers and technology. We like to have monthly meetups to just get together over a coffee/beer to chat about various topics, such as current tech news, what we are using/dealing with in our jobs, or even our current side projects. These meetups alternate locations between, Dooly's and The Rocket Bakery. We have recently started having monthly tech talks from our members and other sources. These talks lean towards a more technical side than the CodeNL talks. We also take part in local outreach programs, such as the CodeNL events, to help promote programming education in Newfoundland and Labrador. Below is a list of our executive who all work together to organize these events.

##Executive Members
- Tim Oram
